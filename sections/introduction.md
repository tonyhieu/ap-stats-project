Teacher salaries are an important part of public education. The amount teachers are paid often correlates to the quality of education, so disparities in funding can lead to disparities in schools. Del Norte is a school reputed for its math and science programs but not its humanities ones. Our team was curious about whether or not STEM and Humanities teachers were paid differently, as a difference in salary would likely lead to a difference in education. Our definition of STEM teachers was a teacher who taught any science, math, engineering, or technology course while Humanities teachers were ones who taught any English, history, art, or language course. Overall, we found 41 Humanities teachers and 35 STEM teachers.
