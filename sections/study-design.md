To gather data for our study, we used the DNHS Staff Directory, which contains all of the staff employed at DNHS. We selected all teachers that taught STEM or Humanities and created two populations out of them (STEM and Humanities).

To ensure there is not any bias present in selecting teachers (i.e. older teachers get paid more), we randomly sampled teachers from both groups. Our sampling method involved assigning each teacher a number and using a Python script to randomly generate 30 numbers without replacement. Afterwards, we got two random samples of STEM and Humanities teachers.

We found the teachers' salaries via public databases such as Transparent California. Transparent California is a website that lists that salaries of government workers, including teachers, for public knowledge. We looked up the salaries of the teachers who were randomly chosen to gather our data.
