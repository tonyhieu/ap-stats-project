## Procedures
To figure out whether one group of teachers actually made more money, we used two procedures: a significance test and a confidence interval. Significance tests allow you to figure out whether or not there is a difference, and confidence intervals allow you to estimate how big the difference might be.

## Significance Test

In significance tests, the goal is to find the P-value, or the probability of getting a result as or more extreme than the one found. The final P-value we got was 0.68. We compare this value to an Î± value of 0.05 because any P-value less than 0.5 is considered statistically significant. Since 0.68 is greater than 0.05, our result is not statistically significant, meaning that there is not convincing evidence that there is a difference between the average STEM and Humanities teachers' salaries.

## Confidence Interval

In confidence intervals, the goal is to find a range of values that the difference in averages could be. We do this by estimating what the difference is and then finding the margin of error. The final interval we got was -4709.14 to 7156.07. This means that the difference resulting from subtracting the average Humanities teacher salary from the average STEM teacher salary could be anywhere between -4709.14$ and 7156.07$. This interval is also inconclusive, as it contains both positive and negative values, meaning that there is no concrete evidence that one average is higher than the other.
