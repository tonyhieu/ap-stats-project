Ultimately, our study did not find convincing evidence that there was a significant difference between the salary of STEM and Humanities teachers.  There were some peculiarities present that are worth mentioning. For one, some of the teachers did not have listed salaries on Transparent California. We listed these teachers as N/A and did not add them into our calculated averages for the salaries of STEM and Humanities teachers. Additionally, we had to use the Finite Population Correction Factor to complete our statistical procedures. This factor is used when the sample is greater than 10% of the population.

Though our study was inconclusive, hopefully it provided some insight into the importance of pay disparity in public school systems. Thank you for reading our report!
